What went well?

Enjoyed the discussion about "idempotent"
	-- voted, lost my ballot, went down to King County Board of Elections, asked "how do I know it hasn't been found and voted?"
	-- he asked if I was an engineer -- have you ever heard of idempotent?
Systematic process was appreciated
Diligent notes were appreciated for review
Liked the Agile methods
Liked doing exercises using Windows Forms rather than console app +
	-- seemed more approachable and hands-on
Liked the theoretical end of discussing delegates 
	-- delegates have been confusing, and working out the different approaches to solving an issue with delegates helped me to understand them better
Class flexibility about presentation/curriculum
I enjoyed the class.
I enjoyed your substitute work.  Thanks.



I should say that today was cool, we have a really good interaction with the classmates and it was a very productive time, and I should say that I really like your polite way of speaking. As a web beginning guy is really helpful listen some pro advices and I am with you, I think we should not expend all our time talking about code syntax in .NET that why exist MSDN website. Talking about how we will modal the real word is the point even for web, as today the websites are more programming than design, however our range of time is short we do not have I big time to discuss all our needs. Please do not get me wrong I like your approach, I would take the rest the course with if Ted never gets back, but I think you should move on our learn agenda a bit fast if you do not mind ( not to fast just a bit ). And if you do not care about my opinion I will still be happy to learn with you next week, it was I really good time. Now to other matter, as I agree with my classmates to not expend time talking about GitHub, but I would like to know more about, then comes my question Do you know? some guy on youtube or some bolg that I can get like a mini course on that matter, I tried google but I collect more information about Git not really on GitHub functionality. Also you are really good with words you should really go on with your blogger, maybe migrate to wordpress and add on a nice theme. best regards.    




Things that could have gone better...

Small program with event and delegate, so we can practice our understanding	+
Would rather use console applications rather than Windows Forms +
	-- because the IDE takes over and does things for you
	-- would most prefer using Notepad++, since it does nothing for you
	-- would have been better to do the delegate learning from a console app
	-- IDE is good for professional work, but for learning, small, focused examples are better for big picture
Book on delegates gave me a headache
	-- gave up reading
A little more focus on the topic of the class would be nice
Mickey could have provided instructions on how to use GitHub, and where to find last weeks class exercises.
	

Deltas (things we might change):

* Write a simple stock-tracking app using delegates and events (as a console app)
Small WinForms app that has a small menu component with a couple of menu items and buttons, 
	and once the button is clicked we see how it manages the related state
* Cover anonymous methods (lambda expressions) and delegates
* Make sure we cover all of the key points from the curriculum
