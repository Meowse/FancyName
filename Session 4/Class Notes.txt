To declare a new TYPE of event, use the "delegate" keyword:

	public delegate void EventTypeNameGoesHere(int parm1, String parm2, Decimal parm3, int parm4);


To declare a new EVENT, of a particular type, use the "event" keyword and the type you declared above:

	public event EventTypeNameGoesHere MyEvent;


To ADD a LISTENER to an event, use the "+=" operator and OMIT the parens:

	MyEvent += SomeMethodThatHandlesEventTypeGoesHereEvents;


	// elsewhere in your code, write the event handler method.
	// Note that the parameters here must PERFECTLY MATCH the parameters for the event type EventTypeNameGoesHere.
	private void SomeMethodThatHandlesEventTypeGoesHereEvents(int parm1, String parm2, Decimal parm3, int parm4)
	{
		// some code you want to run when the event happens
	}


To FIRE an event (and call ALL of the listeners that have been added to it):

	MyEvent(13, "Fred", 19.99, 7);   // This will call (at least) SomeMethodThatHandlesEventTypeGoesHereEvents(13, "Fred", 19.99, 7)
